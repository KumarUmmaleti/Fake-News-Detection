# Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning Algorithms

## About the Project
This project focuses on detecting fake news using machine learning algorithms. Fake news, which is false information presented as legitimate news, has become a significant challenge with the rise of social media and online platforms. The system leverages multiple machine learning techniques, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree, to classify news articles as real or fake.

The workflow includes:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning text by removing stop words and normalizing the content.
- **Feature Extraction**: Using TF-IDF to extract meaningful features from the text data.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Training models on labeled datasets and evaluating their performance based on metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.

The Gradient Booster algorithm emerged as the best performer, achieving high accuracy and precision in detecting fake news. This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in addressing misinformation and providing reliable solutions for real-world challenges.
